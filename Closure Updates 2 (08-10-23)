Dear Community,

[B]REIMBURSEMENTS COMPLETED[/B]

In accordance with the roadmap published on July 25th 2023 within the closure announcement thread ([URL="https://anthrogenica.com/showthread.php?28715-Anthrogenica-is-Closing-on-08-17-2023"]see here[/URL]), we confirm that member reimbursements have been issued today and no further funds exist to maintain the site.

As stated in the referenced plan, a single administrator performed reimbursements in chronological order of payment date (most recent first) and under the full supervision of the remaining active administrators in real-time (complete with anonymization and pre-post summary payment records). 

Over ten Anthrogenica users have been issued with a reimbursement and all but one consisted of a full refund. All Subscription Class or donation payments made up until Feb 2023 have been refunded (with a single user declining a refund offer). 

For completion and in addition to a personalized note through PayPal, we have just sent an email confirming reimbursement to everyone who'd received one from us today. Several of you had registered to Anthrogenica with a different email address-- We wished to maximize communication given this.

We thank all members, past or present, who'd contributed to this site's maintenance.

[B]PRIVATE MESSAGE FACILITATION[/B]

The decision to include private messages alongside the site's shift to read-only mode has been reversed-- Those of you wishing to exchange last-minute contact details with other users may continue to do so until user logins are disabled. 

[B]COMMUNITY-WIDE GOLD STATUS[/B]

During the reimbursement process, we noted that some of our Gold users had lost their status afterwards. 

Due to our uncertainty regarding whether this may limit their private messaging extraction process, we have decided to shift all Anthrogenica users to Gold-- Doing so offsets that possible complication and commemorates the site's final week of online activity.

This change will occur within the next hour.

[B]SUCCESSION DISCUSSIONS[/B]

These remain ongoing and we are seeking resolution as soon as possible-- We are obliged to share that one of the possible successor options is now unfortunately untenable, but are continuing discussions with the other parties.

Thanks for your attention as always.
