<transposition note 08-16-23>This is a direct copy and paste of the original announcement from the forum.

[B]1. OPENING STATEMENTS[/B]


1.1. The following post expresses the consensus position of the existing administrators of Anthrogenica and follows two full weeks of reflection, deliberation and exploration of the site's viability given the immovable constraints outlined below. 

1.2. This post has been reviewed in advance by all existing administrators, in addition to a select number of former administrators, who were liaised with ahead of publication, and is verified as accurate by all.

1.3. Furthermore, we are confident that all former administrators, moderators and/or other members familiar with the site's previously unpublished history, can corroborate those areas of this announcement that they are familiar with on a first-hand basis.

1.4. For brevity, sections of this post that are not site-critical are contained within "Spoilers" for ease of reading. 

[B]2. ANNOUNCEMENT SUMMARY[/B]

2.1 We deeply regret to inform the community that Anthrogenica has no other alternative but to close on Friday 17 August 2023, following over 11 years of continued activity and advocacy from our esteemed members. 

2.2. We have provided our community with a concise, but complete, summary of events leading to this declaration, in the interest of transparency and expediting the internal reconciliation process within our community following this announcement.

2.3. This public statement grants our community under one month to obtain all desired information from the site before closure. 

[B]3. SITE HISTORY[/B]

[spoiler]
3.1. Anthrogenica was founded by five young online friends (DMXX, Ezana, Lenka, Michalis Moriopoulos and Scarlet Ibis) in 2012 to serve as both an orderly structured alternative to other discussion boards hosting similar content, and as a spiritual successor to DNA-Forums, following its unforeseen demise.

3.2. The founders had agreed to organize the administration in a decentralized consensus-based fashion. This structure persisted throughout Anthrogenica's history and no officially designated site lead or owner existed since launch.

3.2. Of these founders, following the resignations of others, two (Scarlet Ibis and DMXX) had officially remained within the administration from launch until the final few years of Anthrogenica's operation (2021 and 2022 respectively) and had handled the site's back-end management until then, but continued to provide limited unofficial support afterward.

3.3. Anthrogenica's core administration consisted of AJL, DMXX, Humanist & Scarlet Ibis (2012-2016) followed by BalkanKiwi, DMXX, GTC, Scarlet Ibis and Taltos (2016-2022). 

3.4. Owing to the professionalism of all historical core administrators, internal cohesion was consistently high and conflict or drama was minimal. However, all administrators have/had substantial real-world commitments, necessitating the site's running on a voluntary part-time basis. Said commitments were the usual basis for resignation.

3.5. Four complicating events occurred during the site's life: a cryptocurrency hack in 2017, the imposition of the European Union GDPR in 2016 (our full implementation by 2019), the commencement of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks from 2020 onwards and the July 2022 domain registration event (section 4.1.). Administrators who had saved the forum in each situation were, respectively, DMXX, Scarlet Ibis & DMXX, DMXX, and BalkanKiwi, GTC & Taltos.

[B]4. RECENT CHALLENGES[/B]

[spoiler]
4.1. Coinciding with the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, various administrators were forced to take periods of unexpected leave from the site - Simultaneously, Anthrogenica began to experience the first wave of DDoS attacks. These unforeseen simultaneous events led to the prioritization of the site's defenses by a limited number of administrators. Unfortunately, due to these challenges, an administrative oversight event relating to domain registration occurred (which was the only non-recurring payment from launch). This oversight was responsible for the unexpected and transient loss of service in July 2022. No loss of data or breach in security was experienced and the event was, therefore, ultimately due to human error, secondary to the distractions generated by three concurrent events (the pandemic, the mounting DDoS threat and an unexpected staff reduction). 

4.2. In addition to the dissemination of vital credentials between the existing administrators following the July 2022 event, contingency planning, risk management, site succession and other forward planning measures were discussed, agreed upon and tentatively initiated, with a view to announce these following their completion. However, by June 2023, all implementation attempts had failed, exclusively due to interference by real-world commitments experienced by most administrators from February 2023 onwards.

4.3. Unfortunately, by July 2023, the majority of the existing administrators expressed their permanent change in personal circumstances, including upcoming and fixed departure dates from the site, and an inability to proceed with the previously agreed organization-enhancing measures, resulting in either formal or deferred resignation. In addition, all of the site's founders had long since left the project.

4.4. Prior to contact with several unrelated legal professionals (section 5.4.), the current administrators had contacted suitable successors from within the forum's recent management. Unfortunately, all responses received had declined the prospect of an internal transition. Following contact with said professionals (section 5.4.), the administration were forced to abandon any further direct succession planning (section 5.7.).
[/spoiler]

[B]5. CURRENT CONSTRAINTS[/B]

[spoiler]
5.1. Although the site itself has largely been community-funded since 2016, the current operation of Anthrogenica requires the registration of certain accounts (including those linked to finances) to facilitate the utilization of certain critical services. 

5.2. Anthrogenica was founded well before the EU GDPR was implemented in 2016. Although the site is broadly compliant with the EU GDPR and other similar legislation and respected all user-initiated data requests, the site remains an unregistered entity without a publicly declared data collector or owner. Discussions to formally register the site occurred before the pandemic's onset and the change in staff circumstances but were not actionable due to the described challenges (section 4.).

5.3. Furthermore, the site's database, which the posts and threads are contained within, is inextricably linked to individual identifiers that are fully subject to EU GDPR and equivalent legislation. 

5.4. Liaison with multiple legal professionals on a separate informal basis for guidance was sought in July 2023. The consensus opinion provided indicated that transfer of ownership given the site's pre-GDPR registration status and the other listed items (section 5.2.) was "not straightforward"/"uncharted territory".

5.5. Of the viable and legal options presented by said professionals, succession from within the existing team, allocation of the site to a legally identified maintenance entity with initiation of formal registration, or closure of the site with the identification of a separate successor created by another set of individuals from within the community was presented. One professional, in their estimation, did not view direct site transfer to be a sensible option, as the burden of responsibilities with respect to GDPR compliance following the transfer event is both onerous and unreasonable.

5.6. Further to section 5.5, despite our best efforts, we were unable to identify successors from within or around the existing team. Due to the legal uncertainty (section 5.4.) and the unexpected recent contraction of the existing administration (section 4.3.), the second option is infeasible, leaving closure the only option.

5.7. The potential of transferring the site to another set of individuals from within the community was considered. On balance, the remaining administration unanimously agreed that a legal means of transfer was infeasible on account of the low probability of identifying suitable individuals able to coalesce, agree to an internal structure and set up the relevant third-party accounts in a limited timeframe (section 4.3.) with a willingness to unmask themselves (section 5.1.) and due to the unreasonable GDPR originating burdens placed on these extra-administrative successors, as advised by one legal professional (section 5.5.). This would have technically been a viable option prior to the EU GDPR (as had occurred with other sites).    

5.8. Given these constraints, and despite our best efforts to secure the future of the site, the remaining administrators had bitterly acknowledged that the site has no other option but to close down. 

5.9. As our exploration of options, acknowledgement of fixed constraints, and near-consensus through outside legal counsel led to this terminus position, both the conclusion and decision is final. 

5.10. In summary, the substantial constraints brought upon by the EU GDPR legislation, the absence of any suitable internal replacements, the inability of the existing administrators to continue running the site and the fixed departure dates by several, has left us with the anguishing decision to close Anthrogenica.

[B]6. POTENTIAL SUCCESSOR[/B]

[spoiler]
6.1. Although Anthrogenica will close on Friday 17th August 2023, we invite any parties interested in creating a separate successor website that meet our predetermined criteria (section 6.3.) to contact us prior to the site's closure date (Friday 17th August 2023). 

6.2. Following the identification of a project prior to closure that fully meets certain criteria (section 6.3.), we will provide the following support up until the closure of the website:
- A public announcement of the official successor
- Communication to all active Anthrogenica users via email informing them of our successor
- Brief guidance regarding technical implementation
- General guidance regarding site administration challenges
- Disclosure of previous site development plans (to be considered by any successors at their discretion)

6.3. In order for any project to be officially declared as Anthrogenica's successor, the following MUST be established, expressed to the incumbent administration (including evidence) before Friday 17th August 2023:

[code]
Major (ALL of the following mandatory)
- Multiple administrators with a single designated lead
- At least one assigned site technician
- Forum software package installed and skeleton site active
- The majority (>50%) of proposed administrators either existing AG users of good-standing OR current/ex-staff OR users from outside of good reputation (as deemed by the incumbent AG admins)
- Have sufficient funds to permit at least two months of continued activity

Minor (preferred items)
- Site structure resembling that of Anthrogenica
- CloudFlare already installed
- Active backup procedures
- Community-based, sustainable funding model
- Preliminary moderation staff listing
- Some evidence of continuity planning
[/code]

This criteria exists to increase the likelihood that the successors may be able to provide a similar (or superior) level of service that we had provided.

6.4. Any interested team that fully meets the above major criteria (with evidence) are welcome to contact the administration ('Contact Us' link on all site pages, message title:'AG Succession Proposal Team'). We will reply to any proposals within two calendar days up until closure (Friday 17th August 2023).

6.5. We are aware of certain entities registering discussion spaces with the name "Anthrogenica" on various third-party platforms. Please be advised that none of these spaces are considered by the administration as successors. As "Anthrogenica" is an unregistered name, we a cannot limit their continued use. We also cannot  limit any repurposing of this forum's appearance or structure by these external entities. Therefore, we advise members to treat these spaces as unrelated to the authentic "Anthrogenica" (this discussion forum).

6.6. We affirm that none of the existing administrators will be involved in any potential successors. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, none of the ex-administrators from the core team (section 3.3.) are likely to co-launch any successor site. 
[/spoiler]

[B]7. CLOSURE ROADMAP[/B]

7.1. Following this announcement, Anthrogenica will remain open for posting and personal message (PM) delivery for one calendar week. 

7.2. Afterwards, the site will enter a read-only mode, with members retaining their ability to log into the site for a further two weeks.

7.3. A phased irreversible shutdown process will occur within two days of Tuesday 17th August 2023.

7.4. Key dates and times are as follows (please permit a maximum of two hours around each of the estimated times):

Tuesday 25 July 2023 16:30 UTC - Public announcement
Tuesday 01 August 2023 08:00 UTC - New posts and PMs by members permanently disabled
Tuesday 08 August 2023 08:00 UTC - First public reminder of forum closure date
Thursday 10 August 2023 16:00 UTC - Initiation and completion of member reimbursements
Tuesday 15th August 2023 08:00 UTC - Member login disabling
Thursday 17th August 2023 16:00 UTC - Site closure

7.5. Moderation of posts will continue until closedown and any unacceptable behavior, such as criticism or harassment of other members, will result in instant account terminations.

[B]8. USER REIMBURSEMENT[/B]

8.1. The current administration are keenly aware of the negative experience had by those who contributed to Anthrogenica's unofficial predecessor (DNA-Forums), where funding members were continuously billed despite the site's terminal status ([URL="https://anthrogenica.com/showthread.php?92-The-Old-Dna-Forums/page5&highlight=Forums"]please refer to this thread[/URL]).

8.2. As stated in our Sustainability Model ([URL="https://anthrogenica.com/showthread.php?7757-Anthrogenica-Sustainability-amp-Your-Support"]please refer[/URL]), we have never implemented recurring billing for any of our user subscriptions, and users had to explicitly opt-in ahead of their annual subscription's expiry. 

8.3. We can therefore assure all those users who had very generously sponsored the site through one of the regular Subscription Classes that, following the site's closure, no further costs will be incurred. 

8.4. The PayPal account that Anthrogenica had used to maintain automated server and third-party costs has remained accessible by all existing administrators.

8.5. On Thursday 10th August 2023, to maximize accountability, a single designated administrator will commence and complete reimbursements for all users (in order of descending date and following an agreed, pre-specified reimbursement to one administrator for historical emergency site expenses) with direct real-time oversight by the remaining administrators.

8.6. Each reimbursed member will receive a confirmatory email from us thanking them for their very generous support for both the platform and our community.

8.7. Once all transactions have been fulfilled and the resulting balance is $0, we will publish a notification on-site confirming reimbursement finalization, in addition to the number of Anthrogenica users that had been successfully reimbursed. 

[B]9. DATA EXTRACTION[/B]

[spoiler]
9.1. Exporting of all public posts and threads will not occur for technical and legal reasons that lie beyond the scope of this announcement.

9.2. No users will be granted any access to the site's database for any SQL extraction procedures for obvious reasons outlined previously (section 5.). 

9.3. However, we welcome those users with the technical abilities to use third-party tools to scrape the public site for relevant content.

9.4. Specific extraction guides for users that are unable to use web scrapers is provided below:

[B]10. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS[/B]

[spoiler]
10.1. We must begin by thanking the community for their patronage of Anthrogenica through both time and financial support. Your trust in the administrators has never been forgotten or underappreciated. We directly thank those users (some may prefer to remain unnamed) for proactively looking out for the site's interests during the uncertainty of July 2022. Your thoughts, words and collective goodwill had more than offset the challenges experienced by us since the beginning.

10.2. We honor the sum contributions of all current and prior Moderators during the site's decade-plus existence. They are and were: Agamemnon, Alpine Hominin, anglesqueville, Angoliga, Awale, Coldmountains, deadly77, Dewsloth, Dr_McNinja, evon, ilmari, JonikW, Kapisa, Kelmendasi, khanabadoshi, Kristiina, Kulin, Kwheaton, LTG, Michal, MitchelSince1893, Onur Dincer, passenger, PLogan, pmokeefe, poi, R.Rocca, RCO, Reza, robert_tce, Ruderico, Sein, soulblighter, TigerMW, Tomasso29 and Wing Genealogist. 

10.3. In addition, we recognize the substantial diligence and perspective of the core administrators of Anthrogenica (AJL, BalkanKiwi, DMXX, GTC, Humanist, Scarlet Ibis & Taltos), in addition to Gray Fox (served during the site's middle period), who upheld and furthered the site's unstated founding ideals. 

10.4. The role played by the site's founders (DMXX, Ezana, Lenka, Michalis Moriopoulos, Scarlet Ibis) is acknowledged and we are certain the community will thank them for initiating the platform's existence.

10.5. Finally, we wish to pay homage to several dear members that had left our community since launch. We continue to honor Jean M, ruth22, Camulogene Rix and all other passed members who had blessed this forum and our community with their presence. May they all continue to rest in peace. 
[/spoiler]

[B]11. FINAL STATEMENT[/B]

11.1. We thank all members and guests that have taken the time to read this post.

11.2. As we hope our community can acknowledge from the above, this decision has been exceptionally difficult. 

11.3. We share in your disappointment concerning the site's eventual closure. However, the maintenance of independent communities is no longer a straightforward endeavor, particularly on a part-time basis. We ask for the community's understanding in this regard.

11.4. We are fortunate to note that, unlike with other communities, Anthrogenica's operations had ceased well before any observable decline in activity, and that we have approached this problem in the most diligent and orderly way possible.

11.5. It is our hope that a fledgling group may present themselves, prior to our closure, and their separate community would meet the conditions for an official announcement of succession to Anthrogenica.

11.6. Regardless of the final outcome, we sincerely hope that our members may continue to propagate the essence of this forum, wherever they may go.

11.7. This thread will be closed for commenting, although a paired discussion thread in The Lounge will be opened for posting and interaction with the administration for up to one calendar week.
